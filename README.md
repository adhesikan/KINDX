# KINDX

A minimal, asset-free landing page highlighting KINDX services. The project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with inline SVG logos and no external images or binary files.

## Structure
- `index.html` — markup for the landing page sections (hero, solutions, approach, contact) with inline SVG logos.
- `styles.css` — styling for layout, typography, and responsive behavior.
- `script.js` — small enhancements for navigation toggling, smooth scrolling, and form feedback.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build steps or dependencies are required.
